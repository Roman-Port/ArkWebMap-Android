# ArkWebMap Android
This is an Android version of my ArkWebMap. You can see the whole ArkWebMap project here https://github.com/Roman-Port/Ark-Web-Map.

Features planned:
* Push notifications when you need to feed a baby dino, or if a tribe dino is tamed or killed. Probably a settings screen for that too.
* A map, much like the home page of https://ark.romanport.com/
* Dino card view. View all of your dinos in one easy place.
* Baby dino card view. View the stats of your baby dinos, with time estimates and such.
* Maybe if this becomes more popular, it's own web domain?
